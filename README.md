### Introduction
If you’ve never played Mastermind, a game where you have to guess your opponent’s secret code within <br>
a certain number of turns (like hangman with colored pegs), check it out on Wikipedia. <br>
Each turn you get some feedback about how good your guess was – whether it was exactly correct <br>
or just the correct color but in the wrong space.

### How To Play
You can chose to guess computer code(Code breaker) or make the computer do the work! <br>
Number to guess is 4 digits, and each digit can be from 1 to 6 <br>
X means that one digit is the correct number and at the correct place <br>
O means that the digit is the correct number but is at a wrong place <br>
Have fun!
