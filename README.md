### Introduction
If you’ve never played Mastermind, a game where you have to guess your opponent’s secret code within <br>
a certain number of turns (like hangman with colored pegs), check it out on Wikipedia. <br>
Each turn you get some feedback about how good your guess was – whether it was exactly correct <br>
or just the correct color but in the wrong space.
